# Z80 Interpreter

This is a Zilog Z80 semi-interpreter (no code execution for now) to 
read hex data off of a Prolite Tru-Color HI-M2014 bus sign and 
hopefully understand how it works so I can try to reverse-engineer
the inputs and write custom messages without the necessary keyboard.
Currently in development.
